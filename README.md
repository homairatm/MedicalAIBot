# Symptoms-Checker

#### Summary: 

I have been thinking about creating a symptom checker application for a while. And this task happens to be aligned with my motivation. So I come up with this project with purpose to cluster diesease symptom information into different groups. The project will focus on online info retrieving, text preprocessing and a simple K Means modeling. The result of this project could provide insight for future disease classfication problems. 

#### Steps:

1. Retrieve symptom information of 11 different diseases from https://www.mayoclinic.org/. I purposely selected diseases from three categories: cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and neurological diseases. 
List of the urls of these diseases can be found [here](https://github.com/gogowenzhang/Symptoms-Checker/blob/master/src/main/resources/urls.csv). 

Example: symptoms of breast cancer
> A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue
> Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast
> Changes to the skin over the breast, such as dimpling
> A newly inverted nipple
> Peeling, scaling, crusting or flaking of the pigmented area of skin surrounding the nipple (areola) or breast skin
> Redness or pitting of the skin over your breast, like the skin of an orange

2. Preprocessing:
  * Tokenize: to split sentence into array of words. Lowercase words except for acronyms.
  
  * Lemmatize: to convert the word into the base or dictionary form. Uses the [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/) dictionary. 
  
  * Remove stop words: to remove stop words using NLTK's list. The list can be found [here](https://github.com/gogowenzhang/Symptoms-Checker/blob/master/src/main/resources/english.txt)
  
  * Vectorize: to maps a sequence of words to their term frequencies using the hashing trick.  
    Based on source:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_hashing   
    Hashing function: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#hashCode()

3. Modeling: Implement a simple K-Means Clutersing model. Apply tail recursion to iterate reassignment of labels and recalculating centroids. 


#### Results: 
| Disease                         | Category          | Cluster Label  |
| ------------------------------- |:-----------------:|:--------------:| 
| breast-cancer                   | cancer            | 2              |
| colon-cancer                    | cancer            | 2              |
| rectal-cancer                   | cancer            | 2              |
| lung-cancer                     | cancer            | 0              |
| adult-congenital-heart-disease  | cardiovascular    | 0              |
| heart-arrhythmia                | cardiovascular    | 0              |
| hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy     | cardiovascular    | 0              |
| brain-aneurysm                  | neurology         | 1              |
| glioma                          | neurology         | 1              |
| epilepsy                        | neurology         | 2              |
| dural-arteriovenous-fistulas    | neurology         | 1              |


#### Error Analysis:
There are two diseases have been mistakenly clustered: lung cancer and epilepsy. 

Some symptoms of lung cancer like shortness of breath and chest pain are also common signs of cardiology problems. While lung cancer's distinguishable symptoms like coughing and coughing in blood are not very common in other kinds of cancers. 

For epilepsy, not enough neurological signals like headache, vomiting or nausea shown in its symptom description. 

Due to very small sample size here, all the errors can be random.
